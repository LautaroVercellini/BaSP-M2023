## 🚀 About The Project

In this repository I will work on a project for Radium Rocket with my team where we will develop a system to manage the schedules of the gym, schedules of the employees, the activities and memberships. Said system must contain functionalities to can sign-up, log-in (both as user, admin, coach, etc.) choose type of membership and reserve classes that the user wish to asist, among others. Throughout the project I will describe week by week, wihch section was developed, and which technologies were learned and applied.


## 👩‍💻 Week 01
We worked on figma, we made a screenflow where the web system of the gym was developed, with all the possible pages and functionalities mentioned in the project description.
We learned about agile methodologies and worked as a team under the scrum methodology.

This week work was done in groups, dividing the system in sections that were developed in groups of 2 or 3 persons.

I worked on the mock-up of the landing page, emphasizing on the correct structure, the perfect syntax and correct utilization of semantics elements of HTML. Also, I learned basics concepts of git y github. I made the commits and pushes to up all to the cloud.

### 🛠 Technologies: HTML - Git - GitHub


## 👩‍💻 Week 03

This week the work was based on style the website. I created the corresponding styles sheet, a reset.css file was used to reset all the default values of HTML elements and I started work from scratch section by section, element by element, developing the website under the "Pixel Perfect" norm.

The pixel perfect modality is based on designing and achieving absolute perfection, making digital products offer a perfect experience to users.

This week was a real challenge!

### 🛠 Technologies: CSS

## 👩‍💻 Week 04

After I worked with the "Pixel Perfect" norm, I finally met Flex-Box!

This week I worked on creating a responsive desing for the website. I started from scratch under the approach Mobile First, developing the css file with the tools that I used the last week and Flex-Box, combining different ways to style the HTML file.

Flex-Box is a CSS3 module created to improve the way of work when develop responsive models, transforming rigid containers into flexible ones, facilitating the work when different elements must be positioned inside them.
