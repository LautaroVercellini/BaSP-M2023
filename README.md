This week the work was based on style the website. I created the corresponding styles sheet, a reset.css file was used to reset all the default values of HTML elements and I started work from scratch section by section, element by element, developing the website under the "Pixel Perfect" norm.

The pixel perfect modality is based on designing and achieving absolute perfection, making digital products offer a perfect experience to users.

This week was a real challenge!

After I worked with the "Pixel Perfect" norm, I finally met Flex-Box!

This week I worked on creating a responsive desing for the website. I started from scratch under the approach Mobile First, developing the css file with the tools that I used the last week and Flex-Box, combining different ways to style the HTML file.

Flex-Box is a CSS3 module created to improve the way of work when develop responsive models, transforming rigid containers into flexible ones, facilitating the work when different elements must be positioned inside them.
