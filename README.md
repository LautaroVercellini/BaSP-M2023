<h2 id="project"> 🚀 About The Project </h2>
<br>
In this repository I will work on a project for Radium Rocket with my team where we will develop a system to manage the schedules of the gym, schedules of the employees, the activities and memberships. Said system must contain functionalities to can sign-up, log-in (both as user, admin, coach, etc.) choose type of membership and reserve classes that the user wish to asist, among others. Throughout the project I will describe week by week, wihch section was developed, and which technologies were learned and applied.

<h2 id="week-01">👩‍💻 Week 01</h2>
<br>
We worked on figma, we made a screenflow where the web system of the gym was developed, with all the possible pages and functionalities mentioned in the project description.
We learned about agile methodologies and worked as a team under the scrum methodology.

This week work was done in groups, dividing the system in sections that were developed in groups of 2 or 3 persons.

### 🛠 Technologies: Figma

<br>
I worked on the mock-up of the landing page, emphasizing on the correct structure, the perfect syntax and correct utilization of semantics elements of HTML. Also, I learned basics concepts of git y github. I made the commits and pushes to up all to the cloud.

### 🛠 Technologies: HTML - Git - GitHub
<br>

<h2 id="week-03">👩‍💻 Week 03</h2>
<br>
This week the work was based on style the website. I created the corresponding styles sheet, a reset.css file was used to reset all the default values of HTML elements and I started work from scratch section by section, element by element, developing the website under the "Pixel Perfect" norm.

The pixel perfect modality is based on designing and achieving absolute perfection, making digital products offer a perfect experience to users.

This week was a real challenge!

### 🛠 Technologies: CSS

<br>
After I worked with the "Pixel Perfect" norm, I finally met Flex-Box!

This week I worked on creating a responsive desing for the website. I started from scratch under the approach Mobile First, developing the css file with the tools that I used the last week and Flex-Box, combining different ways to style the HTML file.

Flex-Box is a CSS3 module created to improve the way of work when develop responsive models, transforming rigid containers into flexible ones, facilitating the work when different elements must be positioned inside them.

<br>
And now, I've met my friend JavaScript!
<br>
This week I worked with my new friend JavaScript, we spent the whole week solving exercises on different topics, such as variables, strings, arrays, if-else statements, for loops and functions.
The objective of this week was to understand the logic of programming with JavaScript to start applying operation to the website.

<br>
And now, we started apply Javascript to our website!
This week the project was based on working with the different forms, both the Login and the Sign-up. The work was focused on validating the different fields of said forms, controlling differents specifications that the tutors gave us.
For example, one of the validations that we had to check was the name. This field could not contain numbers and the length must be greater than 3 characters.
The email must be in a valid format, contain @ and after the "." must have between 2 and 3 characters.
All the validations were implemented with javascript, where if an error occurs, manipulating the DOM, different alerts are generated to the corresponding fields.
It was a very difficult week, where understanding how to apply logic to different functions can be almost impossible in some cases. The bootcamp forces you to get out of your comfort zone, look for different ways of do the work and, above all, can to transform the information acquired into knowledge.

On the updated Mega Rocket Gym website, you can navigate through the different links of the sidebar.

<h2 id="week-07">👩‍💻 Week 07</h2>
<br>
<br>
This week I continued working with JavaScript, but this time a little deeper. The weekly project was based on making a request to the server, using an API that the tutors gave us, to which the data entered by the user had to be concatenated as queryParams. If the data entered was correct, the API returned a successful response, otherwise an error message was returned with the information that the failed field should contain. Also, in the sign-up screen only, in case the API response is successful, the data entered by the user should be stored in localStorage and a function should be created in the window.onload object so that when load the page, the fields are filled with the data already stored.
<br>
During these days we learned about many topics among which are:
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: What is an API
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: Asynchronism in JavaScript
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: Call Stack
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: Task Queue
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: Event Loop
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: Callbacks, Callback hell
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: Promises
<br>
:black_medium_small_square: Creation of cookies and storage of information in SessionStorage and LocalStorage.
